# MedImageViewer

MedImageViewer is a user-friendly GUI application designed for medical image processing and analysis. It aims to provide researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive suite of tools for image augmentation, annotation, measurement, tiling, edge detection, and similarity analysis. Our goal is to facilitate the efficient analysis of medical images, enhancing both research and clinical decision-making.

## Features
- **Annotation**: Manually annotate regions of interest in medical images.
- **Measure Annotations**: Calculate area, perimeter, and other metrics for annotated regions.
- **Find Similar Areas**: Identify and mark areas within or across images that share similar characteristics.

## Software Architecture
MedImageViewer is developed in [Python](https://www.python.org/), utilizing [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI components and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image processing tasks. The application follows a modular architecture, making it easy to extend with additional functionalities.
